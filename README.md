# Newsletter Publisher

Newsletter Publisher is a simple console app that shows the relationship between a publisher and 
subscribers. It is not interactive in any way, not easily expandable, and overall bad.

## Installation

Clone the project and run it in your editor of choice or the console.

## Summary

Newsletter Publisher makes use of the Observer pattern. I made the app to practice putting the pattern into
use. In this case, the Publisher is the Observable, and the Subscribers are the Observers. Since the project
was only made to practice my skills, it is not easily expandable, and is not interactive in any way. If you
wish to add more subscribers or newsletters, they will have to be hardcoded into Main.
